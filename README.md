# stereographic-projector

This is an web application to visualize different paths through terrain data for robotics. 

Concept: You have terrain and need to find the easiest segment through. Let the user choose the route by clicking points on the graph, then translate elevation gain into power

We can also specify robot speed for each segment of terrain.
